# Tiger-RSAECC-Testsuite

The tiger-rsaecc-testsuite uses the tiger-ptv6-proxy. The tiger-ptv6-proxy is placed in front of a connector that meets the PTV5 specification and simulates connector requests 
which meet the PTV6 specification by setting the encryption to be used to ECC in any case, even if previously
was set to RSA. **However, this requires Generation 2.1 cards.**
The tiger-rsaecc-testsuite contains feature tests that test RSA/ECC functionality for PVS and AVS.


### Configuration

Write your connector configurations in a data.yaml that is parallel to the tiger.yaml. This looks like this:

```yaml
connector:
  mandantId: //mandantId
  workplaceId: workplaceId
  clientsystemId: clientsystemId
  address_konnektor: http://here goes the connector url
  port: // here goes the port
  adminport: // here goes the admin port
```

Now replace the values in the date.yaml with the connector data you chose so that they fit your system.

### to note: fixed namespace

The ptv6-proxy basically works by ensuring (for most) operations that the crypt tag is set to the value
`ECC` (or `RSA_ECC`) is set, or sets it accordingly. If the tag is not set in the request, it will be inserted.
However, the namespace of this tag is hardcoded, which can lead to problems if the rest of the xml is a different version
used. That's why the namespaces used now follow via operation.

If you want to make sure that this is really the namespace used, look at the *modifications* section
in *tiger.yaml*.

#### SignDocument

It ensures that the `Crypt` tag is set to `RSA_ECC`.  
If the `Crypt` tag is not present, it will be included with the following namespace:
```xml
<Crypt xmlns="http://ws.gematik.de/conn/SignatureService/v7.5">RSA_ECC</Crypt>
```

#### CheckCertificateExpiration

If the `Crypt` tag is not present, it will be inserted with the following namespace:
```xml
<Crypt xmlns="http://ws.gematik.de/conn/CertificateService/v6.0">ECC</Crypt>
```

#### EncryptDocument

It ensures that the `Crypt` tag is set to `ECC`.  
If the `Crypt` tag is not present, it will be included with the following namespace:
```xml
<Crypt xmlns="http://ws.gematik.de/conn/EncryptionService/v6.1">ECC</Crypt>
```

#### ReadCardCertificate

If the `Crypt` tag is not present, it will be inserted with the following namespace:
```xml
<Crypt xmlns="http://ws.gematik.de/conn/CertificateService/v6.0">ECC</Crypt>
```

#### ExternalAuthenticate

Regardless of whether the `OptionalInputs` tag is present or not, it will be inserted or replaced with the following namespace:
```xml
<OptionalInputs xmlns="http://ws.gematik.de/conn/SignatureService/v7.4">
    <SignatureType xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:dss:1.0:core:schema">urn:bsi:tr:03111:ecdsa</SignatureType>
</OptionalInputs>
```
